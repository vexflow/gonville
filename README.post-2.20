User README for Gonville
========================

This distribution archive contains Gonville, a font of musical symbols
drawn by Simon Tatham and usable as a drop-in replacement for GNU
Lilypond's default symbol set.

This archive is for use with Lilypond 2.20 or later. Older versions of
Lilypond don't have an option to select the music font. A separate
archive, with 'old' in the file name, is provided on the Gonville web
site for those versions.

The Gonville web site is here:

Using Gonville
--------------

To use Gonville as the symbols font for a piece of music you're
typesetting, you need to do two things:

  1. Make sure the files in this archive are available on Lilypond's
     include path. You can do this on Lilypond's command line, or by
     installing Gonville in its data directory.

  2. Make Lilypond include the file 'gonville.ily' while processing
     your score. You can do this on Lilypond's command line, or by
     adding an include command to your input score file.

The simplest way to try out Gonville, without having to modify either
your Lilypond installation or your score file, is to do both these
steps on the command line. You can run a command like this (replacing
'/path/to/gonville' with wherever you put the files unpacked from this
archive, and 'score.ly' with your real input file):

  lilypond -I /path/to/gonville -d include-settings=gonville.ily score.ly

and then your existing score file will be set in Gonville instead of
in Lilypond's default font.

Specifying Gonville in a score file
-----------------------------------

If you'd prefer to specify _inside_ each score file whether you want
that score to be set in Gonville or not, then you can write this
include command inside the score file:

  \include "gonville.ily"

which has the same effect as writing '-d include-settings=gonville.ily'
on the Lilypond command line.

Installing Gonville
-------------------

If you'd prefer to install Gonville in a way that doesn't need you to
specify an -I option every time you run it, you can do that by finding
Lilypond's main data directory, and copying all the files inside this
archive (other than LICENCE and README) into the 'fonts/otf' or
'fonts/svg' subdirectory of it.

For example, on Linux, the data directory is usually called something
like '/usr/share/lilypond/2.20.0', so you might do this (probably as
root):

  cp gonville* /usr/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/otf

If you're not sure where the data directory is, you can ask Lilypond
itself to tell you, by making a file containing these lines and
feeding it to 'lilypond -s':

  #(display (ly:get-option 'datadir))
  #(display "\n")

For example, on Linux, this might report

  $ lilypond -s datadir.ly
  /usr/share/lilypond/2.20.0

and then you can append 'fonts/otf' to that directory to find the
place to copy Gonville to.

(The Gonville files include some OTF and some SVG fonts. You *can*
carefully distribute those between the fonts/otf and fonts/svg
subdirectories of the Lilypond data dir if you want to, but it doesn't
really matter!)

Supported features
------------------

Gonville supports all the same symbols as the standard fonts for
Lilypond 2.20, except for the following omissions:

 - Solfa note head shapes (set using shapeNoteStyles) are not
   supported.

 - The 'longa' note (twice as long as a breve) is not supported.

 - Ancient notation (mensural, Gregorian chant etc) is not
   supported.

Sometimes Lilypond changes the names under which it expect to be able
to find symbols in the font file. I intend to try to keep Gonville up
to date, but please let me know if there are any support problems with
a more recent version of Lilypond.
